this is just a test to how to pull a remote branch to local repository
so, successfully clone remote repo branch to local repo
typing from huda branch
to see how pull works
I am adding this line from main branch
this line from learn-m-c branch
second line from leaen-m-con branch
I added this line from vim editor of ubuntu
Its always nice to use such editor that works in terminal
agian edited this from vim editor in linux terminal
